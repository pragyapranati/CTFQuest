<h1 align="center">CTF Challenge: Hidden Hunt</h1>

### **Overview**

Welcome to Hidden Hunt, a unique Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge! This repository contains an open-source challenge, but the real task is finding it. If you enjoy uncovering secrets, you're in the right place!

### 
- Explore the files and look for clues.

- The flag format is: flag{your_answer_here}.

---
### Rules

- No brute force attacks.
- Share hints, not solutions.
- If you find the flag too fast, pretend you struggled.

---
### Hints

- Sometimes, what you don't see is more important than what you do.
- If you're stuck, take a break. The flag isn't going anywhere (or is it?).
